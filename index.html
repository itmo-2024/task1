            <section> <!-- Introduction -->
                <p>
                    Dear <strong><em>Mr. Mokhov</em></strong>,
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    I am pleased to have been informed that I have been accepted at <q>Hogwarts School of HTML and CSS</q>. <br>
                    Frankly speaking, my parents aren't frontenders. And neither am I... 
                    In this letter I'd like to tell you the truth about me.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section> <!-- Main part -->
                <p>
                    I am not the best CT ITMO student. My A's, B's and C's can be listed in only one simple table:
                </p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Subject</th>
                        <th>Grade</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Algorithms (1 sem)</td>
                        <td>C</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Computer Architecture (1 sem)</td>
                        <td>C</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Discrete Maths (1 sem)</td>
                        <td>A</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Linear Algebra (1 sem)</td>
                        <td>B</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Math Analysis (1 sem)</td>
                        <td>C</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Algorithms (2 sem)</td>
                        <td>C</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>History (3 sem)</td>
                        <td>A</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Operational Systems (3 sem)</td>
                        <td>C</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Optimization Methods (4 sem)</td>
                        <td>C</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                
                <p>
                    But still I am used to learning a lot of maths, writing notes all the time. <br>Writing, writing, writing<sup>2</sup>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some time ago I realised that I barely write any code while studying to all these maths subjects.<br>
                    And I decided to go to Hogwarts. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Remember the part where I said that I'm not the best CT ITMO student? Maybe I am.<br>
                    But I'm very motivated to learn at Hogwarts of HTML & CSS. <a href="https://youtu.be/LKq3Wk345Hg?si=oPHvERPKelFxcc3S&t=571">
                    You give me this, and I will work <br> as hard as it takes to school
                    those CT douches and become the best frontender you have ever seen</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But forget about all this motivational crap. Let me tell you some interesting facts about me & my life:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I'm 21</li>
                        <li>Last year I ran a marathon</li>
                        <li>The A in History I got for:
                            <ol>
                                <li>building a website <ruby><span style="color:grey">(on Tilda)</span><rt>[I'm sorry]</rt></ruby></li>
                                <li>making some QR-codes leading to the website</li>
                                <li>for the Alliluev's museum in SPb</li>
                                <li>(I really liked it)</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>I had the opportunity to learn frontend 3 years ago, but for some reasons didn't take it</li>
                        <li>I love English language so much that I write the word "Ð¯" in Russian with a capital letter</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
