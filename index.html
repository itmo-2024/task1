                <h3>
                    Dear <em>Mr. Mokhov</em>,
                </h3>
    
                <p>
                    I am pleased to have been informed that I have been accepted at <q><strong>Hogwarts School of HTML and CSS</strong></q>. <br>
                    Frankly speaking, my parents aren't frontenders. And neither am I... 
                    In this letter I'd like to tell you the truth about me.
                </p>

            <section> <!-- Main part -->
                <p>
                    I am not the best <abbr>CT ITMO</abbr> (Computer Technologies faculty in ITMO [ITMO is not <br>
                    an abbrevation anymore]) student. My A's, B's and C's can be listed in only one simple table:
                </p>

                <table>

                <p>
                    But still I am used to learning a lot of maths, writing notes all the time.
                    <br>Writing, writing<sup>2</sup>, writing<sup>&#8734</sup>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some time ago in previous semester (maybe it was when I studied for our Math Analysis <br>
                    exam — <time datetime="2024-06-10">June 10</time>) I realised that I barely write any code while studying
                    to all these maths subjects.<br>
                    And I decided to go to Hogwarts. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Remember the part where I said that I'm not the best <abbr>CT ITMO</abbr> student? Maybe I am.<br>
                    But I'm very motivated to learn at Hogwarts of HTML & CSS. <a href="https://youtu.be/LKq3Wk345Hg?si=oPHvERPKelFxcc3S&t=571">
                    You give me this, and I will work <br> as hard as it takes to school
                    those CT douches and become the best frontender you have ever seen</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But forget about all this motivational crap. Let me tell you some interesting facts about me & my life:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I'm 21 years of <var>age</var></li>
                        <li>Last year I ran a marathon</li>
                        <li>The A in History I got for:
                            <dl>
                                <dt>- Building a website <ruby><span style="color:grey">(on Tilda)</span><rt>[I'm sorry]</rt></ruby></dt>
                                <dd>(also an android app)</dd>
                                
                                <dt>- Making some QR-codes leading to the website</dt>
                                <dd>(the QR-codes led to pages that described the exhibit)</dd>

                                <dt>- It was made for the Alliluev's museum in SPb</dt>
                                <dd>(I really liked it)</dd>
                            </dl>
                        </li>
                        <li>I had the opportunity to learn frontend 3 years ago, but for some reasons didn't take it</li>
                        <li>I love English language so much that I write the word "Я" in Russian with a capital letter</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
